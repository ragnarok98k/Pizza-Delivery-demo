1. Overview
A high-fidelity web application prototype for ordering pizza, heavily inspired by the "Pizzy" Dribbble interaction. It allows users to browse a menu, see nutritional data, and "checkout" by sending order details directly to the owner via email or a dashboard.

2. User Features (Functional Requirements)
Hero Menu: Display pizzas with high-quality rotating images (matching the Dribbble vibe).

Nutritional Overlay: A toggle or "info" icon for each item showing Calories, Protein, Carbs, and Fats.

Pizzy Interaction: The "Add to Cart" button must morph into a +/- counter (as seen in the design).

Cart System: Real-time price calculation including tax and a "dummy" delivery fee.

Checkout Flow: * Address Input (Manual text field).

Payment Selection: Cash or UPI.

Note: If UPI is selected, show a static QR code or a "Pay on Delivery via UPI" message.

Order Confirmation: A "Success" animation after clicking "Place Order."

3. Owner Features
Order Routing: When a user clicks "Place Order," the system sends the full order (Item, Quantity, Address, Total) to your email.

🛠 Step-by-Step Implementation Guide
Step 1: Set Up Your Tech Stack
For the "Dribbble-smooth" look, standard HTML/CSS is hard. I recommend:

Framework: React.js (e.g., via Vite).

Styling: Tailwind CSS (for the clean layout).

Animations: Framer Motion (This is crucial for the "morphing" button and page transitions).

Form/Email: EmailJS (This lets you send the order to your email without needing a complex backend server).

Step 2: Build the "Pizzy" Component
Start with the heart of the design: the Pizza Card.

Find a "top-view" pizza PNG on CleanPNG or Unsplash.

Implement the code I gave you earlier for the Morphing Button.

Add a "Nutrition" button that opens a small tooltip or modal.

Step 3: Manage the Cart Logic
Create a global "State" (using React useState or Context API) that tracks:

What is in the cart.

The total price.

Tip: Use the same dark navy (#0F172A) and orange (#FF6B35) colors from the design.

Step 4: The Checkout "Mock"
Create a simple checkout page.

Payment Method: Use a radio button for "Cash on Delivery" and "UPI."

The "Payment": Since you aren't integrating a gateway, just show a "Proceed" button.

Order Notification: Use EmailJS. You set up a template in their dashboard (e.g., "New Order: {{pizza_name}} - Address: {{user_address}}") and call it when the user clicks "Place Order."

Step 5: Hosting (Get it Live)
Push your code to GitHub.

Connect it to Vercel or Netlify (both are free).

Now you can share a link with anyone, and when they "order," you'll get an email!
